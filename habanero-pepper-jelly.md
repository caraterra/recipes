**Yield:** 12 8 ounce jars

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups bell peppers (about 2 peppers)
- 1/2 cups habañero peppers (about 8 to 12 peppers)
- 6 cups granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar
- 2 packets Certo liquid pectin

## Preparation

### To sterilize your jars

- Place jars in a large pot, and lids in a separate, smaller pot, and bring both to a rolling boil.
- Let them boil for at least 10 minutes then reduce to medium heat until ready to use.

### To prepare the jelly

1. Roughly chop the peppers and blitz them in a food processor until fine.
2. Put the chopped peppers into a sieve and press out any excess water.
3. Combine the peppers, sugar, and vinegar in a large pot and bring to a boil.
4. Let boil for 10 minutes, stirring often.
5. Add the pectin, stir thoroughly to combine, then let boil for another 3 minutes stirring constantly
6. Take the pot off the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the jars and lids from the water.
7. Pour the jelly mixture into the jars, being sure to leave a little bit of headroom.
8. Place on the lids and screw on the rings until just snug.

### To can the jars

9. Place the now filled jars into the pot where the empty jars were sterilized, making sure that they are upright and totally covered.
10. Bring the pot back up to a boil and leave for 5-10 minutes for 8 ounce jars, and 10-15 minutes for 16 ounce jars.
11. Remove the jars from the water, and let them cool until they can be handled.
12. Dry them off with a towel and leave them undisturbed for at least 24 hours.

_Note:_ The jelly tastes best after having about a week to sit in the pantry.
