## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 cup whole milk

## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with parchment paper
2. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl and mix to combine
3. Cut the butter into the mix, then add the milk, stirring until a cohesive dough forms
4. Transfer the dough to a floured surface, and flatten out roughly into a 1 inch thick rectangle
5. Fold the rectangle in half, flatten again to its original size, then rotate the rectangle 90 degrees; repeat 4 more times to create a series of layers
6. Cut 6 squares from the dough with a knife, trimming away the outside edges as well
