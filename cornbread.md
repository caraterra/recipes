# Cornbread

## Ingredients

### Dry

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg

### Wet

- 1/3 cup melted butter
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup milk (whole milk is preferable)

## Preparation

1. Line a small baking pan with parchment paper so that it covers the floor and two walls of the pan, leaving the ends of paper protruding like handles. Grease the two exposed walls and preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a bowl, then move the contents to a larger bowl once you realize that you didn’t pick one that was big enough.
3. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the wet ingredients.
4. Mix until thoroughly combined, until only a few chunks remain.
5. Pour the batter into the pan, then bake for 20 minutes (15 minutes if you’re baking them in a muffin tin) or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6. Remove from the oven, and remove the bread from the pan by running a knife along the exposed sides and pulling up on the paper tabs.
7. Serve while hot
