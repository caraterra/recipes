# Welsh Cakes

Adapted from a recipe by King Arthur Flour.

## Ingredients

### Dry ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup of granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon of baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg or cinnamon

### Wet ingredients

- 8 tablespoons or one stick of cold unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup of dried currants or raisins
- 1 large egg, beaten with enough milk to yield 1/4 cup of liquid

## Preparation

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients
1. Cut the butter into small cubes, then add it to the dry mixture, cutting it further until the mixture is evenly crumbly.
1. Soak the currants or raisins in boiling water for a few minutes, then drain and pat dry before adding to the mixture.
1. Add the milk and egg, then mix until a rough dough forms.
1. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and work it until it just comes together. It should be relatively dry.
1. Roll it out into a sheet about 1/4 of an inch thick and cut out the cakes with a 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 inch biscuit cutter.
1. Heat a dry pan over medium heat and add a few cakes to it. They should sizzle very slightly.
1. Cook the cakes on that side until golden brown, then flip. They should release easily from the pan.
1. Cook the other side until similarly brown and done all the way through, then transfer to a cooling rack.

## Notes

- If the butter begins to melt while you are cutting it into the flour, place the bowl in the refrigerator for several minutes before continuing.
- Similarly, when frying the cakes, it is good to place any waiting dough in the refrigerator so it doesn't sit out for too long.
- You can check the doneness of the cakes by looking at their sides. They should look dry at least halfway through before flipping.
